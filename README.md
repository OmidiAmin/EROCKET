# REDUCING THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF LEARNING WITH RANDOM CONVOLUTIONAL FEATURES
This Demo is an implementation of the E-ROCKET feature selection method for removing redundancies of  [MINIROCKET featurs](https://github.com/angus924/minirocket)

In the EROCKET paper, after transforming data by MINIROCKET, the proposed feature selection algorithm is evaluated over [UCR database](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/). In this demo, E-ROCKET has been applied to one of the UCR datasets called [Coffee](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=Coffee). With this demo, you can evaluate the E-ROCKET method over other UCR datasets.

# E-ROCKET methodology
